1 We all have a table like this in our homes. It is a symbol of our reunion of  our families, representing our sentiment and an attachment to our families. 
2 But as a matter of fact, in China, almost everything can be solved  over a round table.
3 The marriage vows between a loving couple, the morning of the deceased, the negotiations between business partners, 
4 and a state banquet to another president from another country, can all happen on the same round table. 
5 The food on the table may change with time. The people sitting beside it may come and go. 
6 The reasons why we come together may be various, but the sensation behind it remains year after year the same. And that is our tolerance of difference people, 
7 our willingness to embrace difference cultures and artistic forms, our care and love and respect for not only our family but also for our community, our nation and even the whole world. 
8 In less than two months, an annual epic migration will take place in China. 
9 Hundreds of people, men and women, young and old, the rich and poor, the dead and the alive, will find a way to go back home and go to the round table to reunite with their families. 
10 The power that drives them to do so has been sustaining Chinese civilization for thousand of years. 
11 And the lives of us, or even the history of our nation, have been the stories of looking for a running to the round table to which we belong. 
12 The round table has been a symbol of the Chinese sensation. It was, it is and it will always be.
